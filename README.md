A recreation of touchscreen controls used in retro Sonic games for Scratch 3.0 or newer. Scratch doesn't support multi-touch, so this script uses a workaround: the touch controls scan for touchscreen taps when the virtual d-pad/joystock is held, which has a disadvantage compared to real multi-touch: only 1 more button can be pressed at a time. Sonic Touch Controls is not Scratchaffiliated with SEGA.
