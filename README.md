A recreation of touchscreen controls used in retro Sonic games, for Scratch 3.0 or newer. Scratch doesn't support multi-touch, so this script uses a workaround: the button also activates when dpad is clicked multiple times, which has a disadvantage compared to real multi-touch: the finger must touch another part of the screen to release the dpad. Scratch Sonic Touch Controls is not affiliated with SEGA.
